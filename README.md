# Overview
The Pizza Sales Dashboard project aims to provide a clear, visual representation of key metrics and insights derived from pizza sales data. This dashboard is designed to help decision-makers in a pizza business understand customer preferences, sales trends, and operational performance, ultimately leading to data-driven decision-making.

# Project Report
## Objectives
The primary objectives of this dashboard are:

To offer a snapshot of total revenue, average order value, total pizzas sold, and other key metrics.
To identify peak sales times and best-selling products.
To analyze customer preferences by pizza size and category.
To enable quick insights for sales, product optimization, and resource planning.
# Data Source
The data used in this dashboard is from a pizza sales dataset, which includes details on:

## Order dates and times
Pizza categories and sizes
Total order values
Sales counts by pizza type
This data has been processed to ensure accuracy and relevance for the insights displayed in the dashboard.

# Data Preparation & Transformation
## Data Preparation in SQL
Data Processing in SQL: SQL was used to clean, filter, and aggregate the raw data. Queries were written to calculate metrics such as total revenue, sales by category and size, and daily/hourly order trends.
Data Validation in SQL Server Studio: Using SQL helped ensure accuracy by allowing complex data checks and calculations directly in the database. SQL queries enabled structured data processing and validation before moving to Excel.
## Data Validation in Excel
After initial data processing in SQL, the data was imported into Excel for further validation:

Pivot Tables: Used pivot tables in Excel to cross-verify metrics calculated in SQL, ensuring data consistency and accuracy.
Summary Statistics: Excel helped validate data summaries, providing an extra layer of assurance before final visualization.
